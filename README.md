Bulk TikTok Video Downloader Guide for Beginners
TikTok has become one of the top platforms for sharing short videos, and if you need to download multiple videos from a TikTok account efficiently, our Bulk TikTok Video Downloader script is the perfect tool. This guide will walk you through everything you need to set it up from scratch, especially if you’re new to coding or Python. We’ll start with downloading the necessary software, setting up the environment, and finally using the script.

Prerequisites: Installing the Necessary Software
1. Download Python
First, you need to download the latest version of Python from the official Python website:
Download Python.

– If you’re on Windows, select the version that matches your system (win64 for 64-bit systems or win32 for 32-bit systems).
– For Mac users, choose the Mac-x64 version if you have an Intel-based Mac. If you’re using an M1 or M2 Mac, you may need a different version depending on your chip.

During installation, make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH”—this is important for running Python from your command line or terminal.

To verify if Python is installed correctly, open your terminal (on macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (on Windows), and run the following command:

python --version
This will display the installed Python version.

2. Download Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Next, you’ll need a code editor for writing and running your Python script. We recommend VS Code, which you can download from
Download Visual Studio Code.

3. Download Chrome for Testing
You also need to download Chrome specifically for testing automation. Visit
Chrome for Testing and download the appropriate version for your operating system:

– **Windows**: Select win64 or win32 depending on your system.
– **Mac**: Choose Mac-x64 if you have an Intel-based Mac, or select the ARM version if you have an M1 or M2 Mac.

4. Accessing Downloaded Files
After downloading Python, VS Code, and Chrome for Testing, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the Downloads folder where your files are located. Use the following command:

cd Downloads
This will allow you to access the downloaded files. Make sure that the ChromeDriver file is in the same folder as your script for easier setup.

5. Running the TikTok Scraper Script
Now, after placing all necessary files in the Downloads folder, you can run the script by entering this command in the terminal:

python tiktokscraper5.py
Make sure the file tiktokscraper5.py is present in your Downloads folder before running the above command.

Create a Virtual Environment
It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This keeps dependencies required by different projects in separate places.

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

Rate Limits and IP Blocking: TikTok may rate limit or block your IP if you send too many requests in a short period. To mitigate this, introduce delays between requests using time.sleep() and consider rotating your IP using proxies.
Updating Script for Changes in TikTok’s API: TikTok occasionally updates its API, which may break the script. Ensure to regularly check for updates on Pyaox to stay updated.
